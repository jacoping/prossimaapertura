Together with the construction site, the community building process is initiated, designed and coordinated by an interdisciplinary working group, with the aim of investigating the local culture, strengthening the community and reconciling it to the public spaces under construction.
Focus groups, public presentations, site visits and coordination round tables gather around the area an active and informed community in a constant dialogue.

At the same time, Prossima Apertura acts as a facilitator between the parties involved, opening up new ways of dialogue between citizens, local associations and public administration. The worksite and the activities promote subsidiarity between the parties, with the aim of building a continuous and direct dialogue that can have positive effects on the city and its citizens.
