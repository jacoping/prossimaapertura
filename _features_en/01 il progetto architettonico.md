Design, in addition to improving the quality of urban space, becomes a complex action, which stimulates the reuse and re-functionalization of public areas. Simultaneously it acts as a tool to strengthen bonds within the community which will inhabit and use those spaces.

The architectural project is entrusted with the task of giving shape to a place that hosts and promotes this process, enhancing the features of the context. The design choices are initially oriented around two fundamental aspects: to make the area accessible, bridging the initial distance and replacing it with an open and inclusive place of relationships; to leave free space for collective uses and experiments, encouraging appropriation by the inhabitants, while suggesting new visions for the neighbourhood. The process aims to create a complete but unfinished space, where indeterminacy is its strongest point.

The new square, measuring 8,600 square metres, is divided into three levels, stitching together the city and "the pit".
At the same level of the urban circulation and facing the park, "the high square" hosts "the ring", a regular iron structure designed for the meeting of several generations. Here, there is space for games and sports, moments of leisure and moments of rest. The floor design, in different colours and materials, organises activities and furnishing elements.
The intermediate level mainly serves the function of connection: stairs, steps and slides delineate on two sides a system of free paths accessible to all, leading to the lower part of the area.

The "lower square" is a free area of 2,400 square metres, imagined to host events and collective activities, facilitated by an industrial concrete floor which, divided into 2 x 2 m modules, is open to possible future overlays. At the centre, a sinuous ribbon-shaped seat marks the boundary of a 300 square metre green area: "the oasis".

Beyond the square, the architectural intervention extends to Parco Europa, a 35,000 square metre green area where an underused space becomes an open air classroom and a collective nursery. By redefining and completing the cycle and pedestrian paths that cross the park, the project transforms the public spaces of the neighbourhood into a system.
