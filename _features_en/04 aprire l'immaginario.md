The planned activities involve both the community, creating new opportunities for meeting and training, and the space, building furniture and light devices that suggest possible uses of the place.

Participation is not understood as the action of questioning the actors of the territory about the purposes, forms and uses considered suitable for the spaces in question, but as a model of intervention that stimulates new ways of inhabiting collective spaces. These ways can sometimes be encouraged: the workshops, especially the hands-on workshops, involve the inhabitants by stimulating the emergence of new links and uses of collective spaces.

# Paint ‘n’ Play
Paint 'n' Play is the first physical interaction between the inhabitants and the space, through the realization of a mural painting. Rub Kandy involves the workshop participants in the creation of a public artwork for the building's ground floor, a privileged place for observing the construction site that has just begun.

A series of coloured geometries intersect with the signs already present on the walls and are recomposed into figures through the technique of anamorphosis. The work invites people to walk along the ground floor and observe the site from different points of view.

# Oratio
The psycho-social research conducted by NOEO goes hand in hand with Alessandro Imbriaco's photographic research, experimenting with new ways of connecting people and places.
The social function of the square is anticipated by the group portraits taken by the photographer, who brings together in his shots people encountered casually in the neighbourhood. The return of the printed image becomes an opportunity to interview the inhabitants and investigate the local culture.

To conclude, the life-size portraits are hung on the walls of the building in a large temporary exhibition in which the residents, neighbours but often perfect strangers, recognise each other and meet.

# Oasis
The construction workshops investigate different types of collective spaces and functions, with the aim of stimulating the imagination and the free use by the inhabitants. The hands-on laboratory happens simultaneously to the construction site, creating synergies and collaborations.

In summer, a green oasis is created within the first part of the square, that has been completed and opened to the public. It consists of a system of wooden walkways inviting people to enter the large green space to stop, enjoy the coolness provided by the vegetation and irrigation, and take care of this new place.

# Urban picnic
The theme of conviviality and food guided the second self-construction workshop, which produced a large circular table that has become a meeting place for the neighbourhood's inhabitants. The element, 12 metres in diameter, is opened to connect the paths in the green area with the access ramps.

Inside the square, a unitary system begins to take shape, in which permanent and temporary elements work together to build an open and changing imaginary.
The table, inaugurated with a large neighbourhood picnic, will be used by a km0 market to collaborate in the promotion of short supply chains and neighbourhood services, while it is already being used for meetings, presentations and daily events.

# Open air
The last workshop takes place in Parco Europa: after a year of pandemic, spring brings us outdoors. Several punctual interventions take place along the newly completed paths, favouring existing uses and inaugurating new ones.

Through a work designed by Rub Kandy, a large paved area is transformed into a playground, then completed with a basketball hoop. A wooden structure connects two paths, becoming a bridge, a playground, a seat, a deckchair and a small stage.

The bowls court, created in an unused area of the park by a group of local pensioners with the help of the contractor, is shaded by two sunshade structures, complete with seats and pots for growing climbing plants.
