The construction site, no longer an exclusive place for workers, becomes a moment of collective creation, an "open" place in which accessibility, visibility and communication involve the inhabitants in the transformation and accompany the progressive appropriation by the community.
The programme along the works is the real innovation of Prossima Apertura. The integrated activities are parallel and complementary actions to the development of the construction site: events in the vicinity, visits to the area under construction, events and workshops in the progressively completed areas. They are all fundamental elements of this urban transformation process.

By including integrated activities in the safety plan of the construction site, Prossima Apertura affirms that the involvement of inhabitants is essential to the construction of a place for the community and attests that urban safety can be promoted through initiatives that do not involve the control and inhibition of uses, but rather becomes maximised when a place is open and inhabited.

While gradually welcoming the inhabitants, the construction site communicates with the neighbourhood through the creative use of temporary structures commonly used in construction work: a banner, installed at the edge of the site, acts as a landmark and announces the start of the activities; the external fence narrates the progress of the work and the collective events that mark its course; a scaffolding staircase becomes temporary access to the square for the workshops.

Starting from the construction of iconic and recognisable elements, the construction site enters into a relationship with the inhabitants long before it is completed, presenting itself to the neighbourhood with a precise identity; at the same time, the opening of dedicated social pages increase the dissemination of the project in the area, opening up new forms of direct dialogue between designers and citizens.
