## The context

Toscanini is a social housing district built in the 1990s on the outskirts of Aprilia. The failure to carry out primary infrastructures for the neighborhood has contributed to the progressive physical and socio-economic malaise of an area with ten thousand inhabitants, who have been waiting for public spaces and services for decades. Over time, neglect, petty crime and unlawful possession of homes have fuelled a general sense of abandonment and insecurity, making “la buca di Toscanini (the pit of Toscanini)” a symbol of the urban planning failure and increasing the physical distance from the inhabitants, recognisable also in the social fabric.
This place, taken away from the community for years, is now the new square: a meeting place for the entire neighbourhood.
